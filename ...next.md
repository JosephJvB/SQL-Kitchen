### Hey, quick fire notes for next steps.
 
- [x] make feature so user can type queries into 'terminal' and have them execute the SQL.
  - [ ] each query is a new 'line' on the terminal.
  - Just for custom queries first (then create NEW query builder aka tablepage 2.0)
      - history -> can store term logs. each log is QUERY+RESPONSE
      - logs are seperated by `SQL_KITCHEN $`
      - render full logs to screen
      - term screen scrolls to keep latest log in view
      - JSON.stringify(data, null, 2) to pretty print server response. Cheap way to do it
      - clear logs on red-term-button press, or \q, or clear
  - [ ] maybe extend this beyond a frankenstein postgres cli: do other terminal commands too.
    - user can swap between postgres-cli and other terminal clients
  - [ ] change behavior of up and down arrows to be more like vscode. maintain position in the line- but move up/down UNLESSlength is different
  - [x] force linebreaks if a line gets too long 
  - [ ] make a query builder section: prebuild query templater. use react-tabs?
 > no XSS PLEASE

- [ ] worker and web and queues and stuff. ...but for what? I wanna use the tech but no idea what I need it for

- [ ] user journey: mac dashboard. Select app. Make table. etc etc. Minimize closes window to dock

- [ ] WAY BETTER ERROR HANDLING especially on custom queries, but also everywhere.
    - errors from my API are caught by response.ok
    - errors from cors/network are caught by .catch()
    - IMPORTANT: best way i could find to send and recieve error messages from fetch>express>fetch
```js
fetch(path)
.then(response => { // must still have access to response after calling json() method(returns promise btw)
// turn everything to json no matter what
// decide if it is error json or success json.
  return response.json().then(json => {
    if(response.ok) // is success json
    else // is failure json: error data
  })
})
// I suppose I could make sure all my end points have a {error: BOOLEAN} property
// I guess that is what I am doing by sending a statuscode tho (400+)
fetch(path)
.then(res => res.json())
.then(json => {
  if(json.error) // error
  else // not error
})
```

- [ ] allow for CSV export of data (whole DB? One table at a time?)

make sure when you do 'create-table' functionality that you auto-add an ID column.
and tell the user that you are auto-adding an ID column

input validation notes: having single quotes ('') in character columns breaks the sql query. I can probably fix that in the chefs tools function

- [ ] actions:
```js
const editTableItem = () => ({
  type: 'EDIT_TABLE_ITEM',
  item
})
```
- reducer:
```js
tableData(state = [], action) {
  switch(action.type) {
    // map state items, if item matches actionItem, return actionItem
    case: 'editItem': return [].concat(state.map(i => i.id === action.item.id ? action.item : i))
    // default
    default: return state
  }
}
```


- [ ] some sort of loading animation to represent async requests
- maybe even something that tells you how long a request took?? Wouldnt that be cool

fetchStatus reducer:
```js
fetchStatus(state = {}, action) {
  /* yikes its all a bit gross below here
    {
      isFetching: bool,
      message: string
    }
  */
  switch(action.type) {
    case 'setFetching': return {isFetching: true, message: null}
    case 'setFetchFailure': // will do the same as below..
    case 'setFetchSuccess': return {isFetching: false, fetchMessage: action.message}
    case 'setFetchIdle': return {isFetching: false, fetchMesssage: null}
    default: return state
  }
}
```
- need something to react to fetchStatusState: 
```js
reactRouteRoot = connectRedux(
  ({fetchStatus: {isFetching, fetchMessage}}) => ({isFetching, fetchMessage})
)({isFetching, fetchMessage} => h('div', [
  // has finished fetching, and there is a message to show...?
  !isFetching && fetchMessage && h(NotificationWrapper, {message: fetchMessage})
  // maybe the notification wrapper is actually my 'Querybar' that I wanted
  // Or do I want two different things..?? That's a design decision I need to make
  h(Route, BASE)
  h(Route, TABLE)
]))
```
