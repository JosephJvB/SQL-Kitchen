### Hey, quick fire notes for next steps.

- [ ] make feature so user can type queries into 'terminal' and have them execute the SQL.
 > no XSS PLEASE
  - Im working on this atm: I can type into terminal and cache text on enterpress
  - [x] keep track of cursor positon
  - [ ] use cursor position to concatenate strings..eg: if cursor is in the middle of a string: add new characters there
  - [ ] on enterpress send the string down to the server to try to execute a custom DB query
    - [ ] proof of concept: `select 1 + 1 as answer`

- [ ] worker and web and queues and stuff

- [ ] user journey: mac dashboard. Select app. Make table. etc etc. Minimize closes window to dock

- [ ] WAY BETTER ERROR HANDLING everywhere

- [ ] allow for CSV export of data (whole DB? One table at a time?)

make sure when you do 'create-table' functionality that you auto-add an ID column.
and tell the user that you are auto-adding an ID column

input validation notes: having single quotes ('') in character columns breaks the sql query. I can probably fix that in the chefs tools function

- [ ] actions:
```js
const editTableItem = () => ({
  type: 'EDIT_TABLE_ITEM',
  item
})
```
- reducer:
```js
tableData(state = [], action) {
  switch(action.type) {
    // map state items, if item matches actionItem, return actionItem
    case: 'editItem': return [].concat(state.map(i => i.id === action.item.id ? action.item : i))
    // default
    default: return state
  }
}
```


- [ ] some sort of loading animation to represent async requests
- maybe even something that tells you how long a request took?? Wouldnt that be cool

fetchStatus reducer:
```js
fetchStatus(state = {}, action) {
  /* yikes its all a bit gross below here
    {
      isFetching: bool,
      message: string
    }
  */
  switch(action.type) {
    case 'setFetching': return {isFetching: true, message: null}
    case 'setFetchFailure': // will do the same as below..
    case 'setFetchSuccess': return {isFetching: false, fetchMessage: action.message}
    case 'setFetchIdle': return {isFetching: false, fetchMesssage: null}
    default: return state
  }
}
```
- need something to react to fetchStatusState: 
```js
reactRouteRoot = connectRedux(
  ({fetchStatus: {isFetching, fetchMessage}}) => ({isFetching, fetchMessage})
)({isFetching, fetchMessage} => h('div', [
  // has finished fetching, and there is a message to show...?
  !isFetching && fetchMessage && h(NotificationWrapper, {message: fetchMessage})
  // maybe the notification wrapper is actually my 'Querybar' that I wanted
  // Or do I want two different things..?? That's a design decision I need to make
  h(Route, BASE)
  h(Route, TABLE)
]))
```
