# Welcome to my kitchen! üë®‚Äçüç≥

*Hi I'm Joe and this is my repo. I work here with my laptop and my dwindling sanity. Every commit here has a story and a bug. One thing I've learned after 21 years - you never know what is gonna come outta that console.*

### THE PITCH:
A juicy Web-App that acts as a GUI for a postgres database. Allowing the user to perform CRUD actions as well as create/drop tables.

Each action performed by the user will be served with a piping hot corrisponding SQL query, to provide a holistic culinary experience. I know when I go out to a database I want to know exactly what SQL is being executed to make sure it is organic and locally sourced.
