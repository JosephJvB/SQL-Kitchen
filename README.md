# Welcome to my kitchen! 👨‍🍳

*Hi I'm Joe and this is my repo. I work here with my laptop and my dwindling sanity. Every commit here has a story and a bug. One thing I've learned after 21 years - you never know what is gonna come outta that console.*

### THE PITCH:
A juicy Web-App that acts as a GUI for a postgres database. Allowing the user to perform CRUD actions as well as create/drop tables.

Each action performed by the user will be served with a piping hot corrisponding SQL query, to provide a holistic culinary experience. I know when I go out to a database I want to know exactly what SQL is being executed to make sure it is organic and locally sourced.

I think the most successful bit of the site for me is the terminal.

SO

I'd like to turn the whole page into a terminal-type view, that you can interact with.
And ideally have UI like a terminal too: --- dashed lines to outline elements I guess that's super easy with border dashed right?

Oh and so I have two main views yeah? Home=all tables overview & Table=single table view. I can have those live as 'tabs' on a terminal.
